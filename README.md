# Pokedex
This is a basic web application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## What Is It?
This application is based off a Pokedex, which is an item from the popular video-game franchise Pokemon. 
The Pokedex displays basic information about the various creatures (Pokemon) from the game. 
Because the franchise has multiple generations with different Pokemon, this Pokedex allows for the selection of a specific game and displays the information based off that game. 
Currently it only supports generations 1 to 5.

All of the information gathered about the Pokemon is fetched from API calls to PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/. Information is stored for later use to minimize the amount of API calls that this application makes.
